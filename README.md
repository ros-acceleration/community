## The ROS 2 Hardware Acceleration Stack

The ROS 2 Hardware Acceleration Stack is a series of *extensions to ROS 2 which allow to leverage hardware acceleration and create custom compute architectures providing <ins>a faster ROS 2 execution and a timing-safe event-driven programming interface</ins>*. The stack is composed of 4 key elements and aims to be hardware and vendor-agnostic:

| # | Standard/convention | Title | Rationale |
|---|---------------------|-------|-----------|
| `1` | [REP 2009](https://ros.org/reps/rep-2009.html) | [`Type Negotiation Feature`](https://ros.org/reps/rep-2009.html) | Allow ROS 2 Nodes to dynamically negotiate the message types used by publishers and subscriptions, as well adaptively modifying the behavior of publisher and subscriptions to align with accelerators |
| `2` | [REP 2008](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/324) | [`ROS 2 Hardware Acceleration Architecture and Conventions`](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/324) | Architectural pillars and conventions required to introduce hardware acceleration in ROS 2 in a scalable and technology-agnostic manner. Presents one interface for all hardware acceleration vendors. |
| `3` | [REP 2007](https://ros.org/reps/rep-2007.html) | [`Type Adaptation Feature`](https://ros.org/reps/rep-2007.html) | An extension to rclcpp that will make it easier to convert between ROS types and custom, user-defined types for Topics, Services, and Actions. |
| `4` | [REP 2000](https://ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html) | [`ROS 2 Releases and Target Platforms`](https://ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html) | Production-grade multi-platform ROS support with Yocto |

The ROS 2 Hardware Acceleration Working Group contributes and maintains open source implementations of various components of the stack above. A complete implementation of the `ROS 2 Hardware Acceleration Stack` including professional support, documentation, examples as well as reference designs is available at Acceleration Robotics' [ROBOTCORE‚Ñ¢](https://accelerationrobotics.com/robotcore.php). Other solutions that implement *part of the stack* include AMD's [KRS](https://xilinx.github.io/KRS/) (the Kria Robotics Stack), or NVIDIA's NITROS (NVIDIA Isaac Transport for ROS).

### Adding your board

The recipe for adding a new board to the community is as follows ([reach out](mailto:v.mayoralv@gmail.com) :email:  if you need help):

1. Check out the [Initial draft of REP-2008 - ROS 2 Hardware Acceleration Architecture and Conventions](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/324)
2. Create your own firmware repository (e.g. `acceleration_firmware_Ultra96V2`) for the corresponding board (see [acceleration_firmware_kv260](https://github.com/ros-acceleration/acceleration_firmware_kv260) for an example)
3. Once the firmware repo is finalized, assess the capabilities of the hardware according to REP-2008 and create a table in the README.md that argues about it (see [example here](https://github.com/ros-acceleration/acceleration_firmware_kv260#hardware-acceleration-capabilities))
4. Submit a PR to [ros-acceleration/community](https://github.com/ros-acceleration/community) to add your board to the community, with the corresponding support level according to REP-2008

### Standards for subprojects

Subprojects must meet the following criteria (and the WG agrees to maintain them upon adoption).

* Build passes against ROS 2 Humble
* If packages are part of nightly builds on the ROS build farm, there are no reported warnings or test failures
* Issues and pull requests receive prompt responses
* Releases go out regularly when bugfixes or new features are introduced
* The backlog is maintained, avoiding longstanding stale issues

### Adding new subprojects

To request introduction of a new subproject, add a list item to the "Subprojects" section and open a Pull Request to this repository, following the default Pull Request Template to populate the text of the PR.

PR will be merged on unanimous approval from Approvers.

### Subproject changes

Modify the relevant list item in the "Subprojects" section and open a Pull Request to this repository, following the default Pull Request Template to populate the text of the PR.

PR will be merged on unanimous approval from Approvers.

### Deprecating subprojects

Projects cease to be useful, or the WG can decide it is no longer in their interest to maintain. We do not commit to maintaining every subproject in perpetuity.

To suggest removal of a subproject, remove the relevant list item in the "Subprojects" section and open a Pull Request in this repository, following instructions in the Pull Request Template to populate the text of the PR.

PR will be merged on unanimous approval from Approvers. If the repositories of the subproject are under the WG's GitHub organization, they will be transferred out of the organization or deleted at this time.
